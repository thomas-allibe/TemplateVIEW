|Stop Core

|+++In addition to the following, this method also sends a message to the monitor to notify it that the actor has stopped execution.+++

+++(<B>Filename</B>: Actor Framework.lvlib:Actor.lvclass:Stop Core.vi)+++



+++Defines what the actor does before it stops. Use the <B>final error code</B> input to determine whether the actor shut down in response to an error.+++



+++By default, this method does nothing. A descendant class may override it to define behavior, such as shutting down any processes the actor initiated in its override of the Actor Core method.+++

|Substitute Actor

|+++(<B>Filename</B>: Actor Framework.lvlib:Actor.lvclass:Substitute Actor.vi)+++

+++This method copies information from the <b>Current Actor</b> to the <b>Substitute Actor</b>, including the to-self and the to-caller queue references. The purpose of this function is to allow an actor to define a method that replaces itself with another actor, useful for implementing a State Pattern Actor. Child classes should override this method to copy any additional fields that they need from the current to the substitute.+++

+++This method may return error code 678010: Illegal substitution. Overrides of this method may choose to return this error if the new actor is not one that is an appropriate substitute for the current actor, for whatever standards of "appropriate" are chosen for the current actor. If returning an error, override VIs should return the unmodified <b>Current Actor</b> as <b>Substitute Actor out</b>.+++
